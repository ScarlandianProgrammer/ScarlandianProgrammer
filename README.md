### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a computer programming student at Clover Park Technical College in Lakewood, WA.

Some of the projects that I've worked on:
- <a href="https://github.com/NullPointer1331/DnDesigner.git">DnDesigner</a>: A D&D resource site that lets you make interactive online character sheets for free.
- <a href="https://github.com/ScarlandianProgrammer/CPWeCommerceSite.git">CPWeCommerceSite</a>: An eCommerce site that I made from scratch while learning .NET WEB programming.
